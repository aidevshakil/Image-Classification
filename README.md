# Image Classification by Machine Learning Using Python
---
![test](test.png)

This project is a **Streamlit application** designed to perform image classification using two powerful machine learning models: **MobileNetV2** and a custom **CIFAR-10 model**. The application allows users to upload images and receive predictions along with confidence scores. It features a user-friendly navigation bar for seamless switching between models and delivers real-time results. This app is ideal for educational purposes, showcasing the performance of state-of-the-art models, and practical use in various image classification scenarios.

- **📱 MobileNetV2 (ImageNet)**:
  - Recognizes 1,000 different classes from the ImageNet dataset.
  - Includes everyday objects, animals, vehicles, and more.
  - Lightweight and optimized for mobile and web applications.

- **🖼️ Custom CIFAR-10 Model**:
  - Specializes in classifying images into ten categories: 
    - ✈️ Airplane, 🚗 automobile, 🐦 bird, 🐱 cat, 🦌 deer, 🐶 dog, 🐸 frog, 🐴 horse, 🚢 ship, and 🚚 truck.
  - Designed for smaller-scale image classification tasks.

### 2. **Intuitive Interface**

- **🔀 Sleek Navigation Bar**:
  - Effortlessly switch between MobileNetV2 and CIFAR-10 models using a sidebar menu.

- **⏱️ Real-Time Predictions**:
  - Upload images in JPG or PNG format and receive instant classification results.
  - Displays predictions along with confidence scores for better understanding.

### 3. **Educational and Practical Benefits**

- **📘 Educational Value**:
  - Learn about deep learning models, their architecture, and real-world performance.
  - Experiment with two different model types for comparative analysis.

- **💡 Practical Applications**:
  - Use the app for tasks requiring quick and accurate image classification.
